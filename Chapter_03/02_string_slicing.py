#in strings for single length we have to give exact value
# form one particular value of string to and other particular value:
# initially exact value and end value should be greather than the exact value of length
#for skip we will apply above both with a skip part for for eg , 
# it cannot start with 0 and for 1 it will not skip only one value ,
# for 2 it sill skip 1 value and go for another.
